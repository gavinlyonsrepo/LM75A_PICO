Overview
--------------------------------------------
* Name: LM75A
* Description: 
Library for LM75A  temperature sensor
* Author: Gavin Lyons
* Developed on
	1. Raspberry pi PICO RP2040
	2. SDK C++ compiler G++ for arm-none-eabi
	3. CMAKE , VScode
* Ported from  [STM32 library](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/STM32_projects)

This is a library for TI LM75A Digital Temperature Sensor and Thermal Watchdog With Two-Wire Interface Temperature Sensor I2C.

1. Shutdown Mode to Minimize Power Consumption
2. Up to Eight LM75As can be Connected to a Single Bus
3. Power up Defaults Permit Stand-Alone Operation
4. Supply Voltage
	/* LM75A: 2.7 V to 5.5 V
5. Supply Current
	* Operating: 280 μA (Typical)
	* Shutdown: 4 μA (Typical)
6. Temperature Accuracy
	*  25°C to 100°C: ±2°C (Max)
	*  55°C to 125°C: ±3°C (Max)
7. I2C 2 wire 400Khz

The LM75A provides 9-bit digital temperature
readings . The LM75A has a dedicated over-temperature output
(O.S.) with programmable limit and hysteresis. This
output has programmable fault tolerance, which lets
the user to define the number of consecutive error
conditions that must occur before O.S. is activated.
Shutdown low current mode included. 

Power up mode:
 - Comparator mode
 - Tos = 80 °C
 - Thyst = 75 °C
 - OS active low

Pin 3 is the OS (overtemperature shutdown). It can be used to to trigger a pin interrupt.
Set the functional mode, Tos and Thyst: if that functionally desired.

**Connections**

The Sensor uses I2C for communication's, data is outputted to a PC.
Pins and I2C port can be set in the main.cpp. Default is I2C0 and GPIO16(data) GPIO17(clock).
If you want to use the other I2C port (I2C1) in addition to changing in the main.ccp,
The user must change it in library (lm75.h) as well:
* i2c_inst_t *i2c = i2c0 to i2c_inst_t *i2c = i2c1
Could not find a way around this.
 
**Files**

The main.cpp contains tests showing library functions
There is also the library files(LM75A.cpp and LM75A.h),

**Output**

Data is outputted  to the PC.
Switch between the two routines modes by changing define statement in main.cpp 
Can also be toggled between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
 
1. Basic Usage
2. Library test routine
